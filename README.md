Currently finishing LAT which can be found on my public repository list. Also developing a personal IOCTL driver & loader designed for EAC, that can map while being unsigned safely which will also bypass CR3 shuffling & patchguard. This will most likely stay private as its main usage, would only be for personal use & friends.
## ðŸ”­ Primary coding languages.
- C++/C#
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Python
- SkillFix
- Java
## ðŸ’¬ More information
- I've been studying C++, aswell as other languages for over 6 years now. I've been devloping all sorts of computer software, with examples like my quality-of-life software, or even my memory-manipulation software. I've been developing game-cheats, ranging from user-level internals & externals, to kernal-level internal for over 4 years now. Believe it, or not; I do actually have a huge life outside of coding, I like to keep this hobbie away from my social-life
